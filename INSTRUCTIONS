Install a Ubuntu Desktop VM,  we will need a web browser eventually.

apt-get install nodejs
apt-get install npm
apt-get install mongodb
apt-get install openjdk-7-jre-headless
mkdir project; cd project
npm install express mocha wd selenium-server urlencoded-request-parser express-json body-parser
npm install urlencoded-request-parser body-parser underscore colors async q chai chai-as-promised wd supertest

#npm install will install all the packages in package.json
npm install

# Globally install so that you can run the executables
npm install -g nodemon
npm install -g mocha


Create a simple web site with the following characteristics:


Login page that takes a user name and password.
Main page that goes to three other pages.
The three other pages should have a links back to the main page.
All three pages should have separate forms that fill in tables on the same page with info from the form.  Store tables entries in in server variables.

Then try the following in three windows:
nodemon app.js
java -jar selenium-server-standalone-2.45.0.jar
mocha test.js
if your curious open a browser in http://localhost:8088
